# blitz_bulletins

A simple Ruby shell script for parsing a set of text/export files related to Dartmouth's outgoing BlitzMail Bulletins system. This script was built, largely, as an exercise in using RSpec and Aruba to BDD the creation of a command-line based Ruby project. It's packaged as a gem for the nice project folder structure and ease of distribution, should that become necessary. This gem will not be pushed to rubygems.org.
